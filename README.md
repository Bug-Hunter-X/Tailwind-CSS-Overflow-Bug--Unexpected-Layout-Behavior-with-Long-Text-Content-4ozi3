# Tailwind CSS Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to text overflow within containers.  The issue is not easily reproducible and occurs under specific conditions, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description
The bug manifests when long text content is applied to a div with specific Tailwind CSS classes.  Instead of gracefully handling overflow (e.g., with ellipsis), the layout behaves unexpectedly, potentially breaking the overall design.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and examine the code.
3. Observe the layout in a browser.  The bug will become apparent when the text content within the div is significantly longer than the container width.

## Solution
The solution is presented in `bugSolution.js`.
